# Mobile Robot Simulations in ROS C++

## Localisation

Given a map of the stati environment, the robot is able to find its position in the environment.

Uses likelihood-based-range-finder model and Adaptive Monte Carlo Estimation

## Mapping

Simulation results from GraphSLAM algorithm. The robot explores the environment and creates a 2D occupancy grid map,
along with a 3d registered map of the entire environment.
